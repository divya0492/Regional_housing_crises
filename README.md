# Regional Housing Crisis

## Problem Statement
A regional housing crisis signifies a severe imbalance between the demand for and supply of suitable, affordable housing. This imbalance manifests in several critical issues: 
•	Housing Affordability: A significant portion of the population faces housing costs exceeding 30% of their income, leaving them "cost-burdened" and vulnerable to housing instability. 
•	Housing Availability: A shortage of available units across all housing types (rental, ownership) exacerbates competition, driving prices higher and limiting choices for individuals and families. 
•	Homelessness: The lack of affordable housing contributes to increased homelessness, impacting individuals and families experiencing poverty, mental health challenges, and other vulnerabilities. 
•	Community Impacts: The crisis can lead to social and economic strain, hindering community growth, attracting and retaining a skilled workforce, and impacting overall quality of life.
